# API AI Demo

A simple AI demo made with React, inspired by Mindhive. 

## About the Project

This is a small AI assistant demo that summarizes and analyzes the emotional tone of a message.

I created this to explore React and OpenAI API, and to show my motivation and interest.

It’s inspired by the Mindhive website – including the colors and overall vibe.
